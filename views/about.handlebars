			<p>Hello hello! Welcome to my little portfolio. My full name is not so little, however, so I prefer the name Alexie Sousa. Art, apples, a cappella and alpacas are some of my favorite things and I have such a sweet tooth that I wonder why I haven't gotten more cavities by now. I'm well versed in cartoon illustration and Adobe Photoshop. I have experience working with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe After Effects, Adobe InDesign, and Autodesk Maya. As for coding, I'm all about the frontend, with a focus in UX/UI. I am interested in pursuing a career in graphic design and web development. Feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions or comments! Thanks for popping by for a peak at my portfolio.</br></br>
			Cheers!</br>
