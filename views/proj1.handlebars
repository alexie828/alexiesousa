Just remember, one uncrossed 'T' and your runners are deadlion kibble. But if they manage to survive, you can turn their ratty tent city into a bustling town.

				<h1>ARTWORK AND ANIMATION</h1>
				<p>All of the artwork in the application was illustrated by me. Variety was something I valued, so I designed a racially diverse cast of runners. I also animated all of the artwork to give the users a treat while using the app.</p>

				<h1>AN INTERFACE THAT PROVIDES A GREAT EXPERIENCE</h1>
				<p>The interface saw many changes before its final product. I designed the interface to be as simple as possible, opting for four navigation buttons at the bottom to toggle between each page. Mission creation is the main purpose of the app, so it was important enough to have its own button at the top. Even the tech-unsavy was able to navigate our app with little problem.</p>
